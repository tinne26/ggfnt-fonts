# Sources for font building

The subfolders in this directory contain the necessary code to build the fonts exposed through the main API.

Ideally we would create the fonts directly through a font editor, but I haven't built that yet for ggfnt, so here we are.

Notice that the code here doesn't have anything to do with the main functionality exposed by the project APIs, it's only internal stuff that I prefer having backed up and public.

Notice also that this code is not licensed, as it contains representations of the font glyphs themselves (but feel free to use the structure and basic methods as reference).
