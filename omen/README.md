# omen
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/omen.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/omen)

An uppercase font vaguely inspired by old norse glyphs. It has a fair amount of irregularities that make it more distinctive, but also somewhat unstable for general UI use.

The import path is:
```Golang
import "github.com/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/omen"
```

## Glyphs

Common glyphs:
- Complete ASCII range except for lowercase letters `a-z`.
- A few additional punctuation signs and diacritics: `¿ ¡ · ´ ¨`.
- Some accents and diacritics `À Á Ä Â È É Ë Ê Ì Í Ï Î Ò Ó Ö Ô Ù Ú Ü Û`.
- `Ñ` and `Ç` for spanish.

The font includes a setting to change the "O" from the unique default shape to a more neutral version if desired.
