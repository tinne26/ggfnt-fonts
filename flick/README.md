# flick
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/flick.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/flick)

A very silly font designed to test glyph animation in ggfnt. Uppercase only, very limited charset, and most glyphs are very similar or identical to tinny, with a few others being more similar to graybit instead.

The import path is:
```Golang
import "github.com/tinne26/ggfnt-fonts/flick"
```

## Glyphs

Common glyphs:
- Complete ASCII range except for lowercase letters `a-z`.
- A few additional punctuation signs and diacritics: `¿ ¡ · ´ ¨`.

The font also includes a couple glyph pickers to make it easier to get animated results. See the pkg.go.dev docs.
